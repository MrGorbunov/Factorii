# Factorii
An ascii based Factorio-like game.

Written in Java, builds in Gradle, and rendering is handled
by a asciiPanel, taken from [here](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2011/08/roguelike-tutorial-01-java-eclipse.html). 

All game logic is written by hand, without any engine. For
some information on the direction of the project, look at 
GameDesignDoc.md or build it yourself. Currently is pretty early in
development (10% done).
