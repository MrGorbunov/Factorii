# Factorii
An ascii based Factorio-like game.

Written in Java, builds in Gradle, and rendering is handled
by a asciiPanel, taken from [here](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2011/08/roguelike-tutorial-01-java-eclipse.html). 

All game logic is written by hand, without any engine. For
some information on the direction of the project, look at 
GameDesignDoc.md or build it yourself. Currently is pretty early in
development.


## How To Play

### Controls
**Arrow Keys** *Movement* - Movement & Menu selection

**Space** *Action* - Select menu item, confirm placement, harvest surrounding

**C** *Open Inventory* - Opens inventory, or if adjacent to configurable factory part (chest, crafting table), it will open their screen

**Z** *Change Active Region* - Switches the active region on the screen

### What to do
This won't spoil much of the game, mostly just getting comftorable with the controls. Follow this list and then you're off to explore.

1. **Move Around** - You spawn on an island, so you can move around but you can walk on water or over trees.

2. **Get Some Resources** - Walk over to a tree or some rocks, and then press & hold space.
 
3. **Craft a Workbench** - Open up your inventory (**c**), then select the workbench. You can close your inventory by pressing **c** again.
 
4. **Place it down** - Close your inventory, you should see a crafting bench at the bottom of your screen, in your items inventory. Press **z** to switch to that region, then **space** to select the crafting bench. Use arrow keys to move it around and **space** one final time to confirm placement.

5. **Open it up** - With it placed down, stand next to the crafting bench and open inventory. You will now see many more options for crafting.

6. **Explore the Crafting** - There's your tutorial. Now get playing! Note that later in the game item tubes get introduced and they can be a little confusing so definitely read the descriptions.
