# Factorii - Game Design Document

## Resources
In this game there are the following resources
 - Wood
 - Stone
 - Sand > Glass (via Kiln)
 - Coal
 - Copper Ore > Copper Bars (Kiln or Forge)
 - Iron Ore > Iron Bars (Forge)

You start off only able to collect wood & stone. Crafting a pickaxe
allows you to mine stone, and a shovel lets you get sand. The forge
also can create alloys:
 - Steel (Iron + Coal)
 - Bronze (Copper + Iron) *This might not be in the game*



## Craftable Items
In this game there are ~25 craftable items. A lot of these items fall
into progressions (direct upgrades) of their own. 

### Resources
- **Glass**: Sand gets processed into glass
- **Copper Bars**: From copper ore
- **Iron Bars**: From iron ore
- **Bronze Alloy**: Copper + Iron
- **Steel Alloy**: Coal + Iron

### Resource Collection
- **Pickaxe**: Can now mine coal & ores
- **Shovel**: Can now pick up sand
- **Mining Drill**: Produces stone, coal, & ores when used, without
	requiring the resource on the surface. If placed on a
	beach will produce sand.
- **Auto Mining Upgrade**: Placed on top of a mining drill to
	make it automatic.

### Improved Crafting
- **Workstation**: Can craft more items
- **Copper Workstation**: Can be set to automatically craft input items.
- **Kiln**: Allows for copper processing
- **Forge**: Allows for Iron & alloy processing. 

### Improved Mobility
- **Boat**: Can now walk on water
- **Tall Boots**: Can now walk over funnels
- **Wooden Float**: Allows for walking over what was water
	does get in the way of boats
- **Bronze Float**: Like wooden floats, but machinery can be placed on them

### Item Transport
- **Chest**: Holds upto 100 items. Funnels pull out & put items into chests
	automatically. If next to an item-producing station (ex: Kiln) will
	get filled up automatically.
- **Wooden Funnel**: Transfers items along a direction. Items cannot be picked
	up mid-transport. Cannot be above water.
- **Copper Funnel**: Same as wooden, but moves items faster.
- **Iron Funnel**: Same as Copper but allows for merging funnels together.
- **Steel Funnel**: Same as Copper but allows for spliting (sorting).

### Submarine
The end goal for the game is to produce a submarine. The submarine itself requires creating the following parts, and then crafting them all together:
 - Hull
 - Control Unit
 - Air Tanks


## Crafting Progression
**From here down a lot of the recipes are subject to a lot of change**
- Crafting Station: 5x Wood, 1x Stone

Progress is made by crafting. After some wood, you can make a 
workstation that opens up crafting. All crafting is done here, but 
the kiln & forge allow for metal processing required for other crafts.
 - Pickaxe: 1x Wood, 1x Stone
 - Chest: 3x Wood, 1x Stone
 - Wooden Funnel: 2x Wood
 - Wooden Floats (only player can stand): 4x Wood
 - Kiln: 2x Wood, 5x Stone
*After the chest, you unlock the kiln*

**From here down, it doesn't make sense to make recipes without testing**

The Kiln unlocks
 - Boat: 3x Wood, 2x Copper
 - Shovel: 1x Wood, 1x Copper
 - Copper workstation: Workstation + 1x Copper
 - Copper funnel: 2x Copper
 - Glass production: 1x Sand -> 1x Glass
 - Mining drill: 1x Wood, 5x Stone, 1x Copper
 - Forge: Kiln + 3x Copper
*After the mining drill, you unlock the forge*
*Placing the forge on sand will allow for sand intake*

Then later on you can make a forge, which unlocks 
 - Bronze floats (can build on them)
 - Auto Mining Upgrade => automatic mining (tip, gear work, etc)
 - Iron Funnel
 - Steel funnel
 - Tall boots

Submarine => End goal
 * Air Tanks
 * Hull
 * Control Unit
 * Glass

It may be good to add saplings & allow for replanting trees?
