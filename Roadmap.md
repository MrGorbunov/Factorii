#### Cleanup
- [x] Switch factory tiles to class-based
  * Still hold tiles?

      on the placement screen if there are more items
      to be placed

- [ ] ~~Inheritence / interface for subscreen~~
  * ~~Maybe also for handling input?~~

- [ ] ~~Inheritence for Factory classes~~

- [x] Turn all screens into statemachines
  * Refactor input handling in the craft screen

- [x] Move tile methods into the tile enum
  * Static
  * Namely collisions

- [x] Move player out of the World class

- [x] Switch to a constant fps game clock
  * Update functions for movement

    * Maybe use modifier keys (shift, ctrl, etc) for larger stack transfers (chest)

- [x] Instead of crafting location, have workbench FacData classes to provide the available crafts.

- [x] Go to update mode w/ constant fps
- [x] Rename project to be factorii instead of minirpg
- [x] Create consistency in file names

- [x] Make sure Auto-Crafting cannot craft equipment
- [x] Rework FacData priority in World.getAdjacentFactoryData();
